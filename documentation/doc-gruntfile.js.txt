====== Documentation for Gruntfile.js ======

Gruntfile.js is used by the grunt program, which is installed in node_modules
You can see the various grunt libraries used in the devDependencies section of package.JSON

Grunt requires that the grunt-cli is installed globally on the users development system.
This must be installed by the user with the following command:

  sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

Grunt watches the js, scss, html, and php files in the src folder, and
when they change it updates them in the public folder.
