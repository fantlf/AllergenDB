====== Documentation for app.js ======

app.js is the main javascript file that holds the primary angular module: HCdietsApp

app.js has three main sections

config
  - Handles the routing. Shows which page to display and with which
  - controller based on the path after # in the address bar

run
  - Saves information through a page refresh.
  - Important information is stored in cookies and the rootscope
  - on a page refresh, the rootscope is dumped, so this file takes
  - what is in the cookies and puts it back in the rootscope

controller
