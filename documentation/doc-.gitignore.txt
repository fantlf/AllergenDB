====== Documentation for .gitignore ======

.gitignore is a small file containing the names of
the folders and files that should not be included in the repository.

Git reads this file and does not upload the files and folders within.

node_modules is excluded because it is very large, and package.json allows
npm to install the appropriate libraries in to this folder.

npm-debug.log is sometimes generated when installing node_modules.
This debug is only relevent to the person who is installing the node_modules,
so it shouldn't be included in git.
