The first three questions in this quiz focus on Exposition. Anytime that you write an academic essay, you will be expected to offer some exposition. This is the part of your essay where you explain in detail some theory, argument, or concept. The purpose of an exposition is, first, to demonstrate that you know what you are talking about, and second, to highlight for your reader some basic information that will become important later on. A good exposition is a summary in your own words of some important idea. When you write your mid-term and final essays, I will grade your essay on its exposition.
